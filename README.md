# Senior Meeseeks: Machine Learning applied to Xconnect module

For this hackathon we have proposed a module which combines different components such as XConnect and Machine Learning. Which together can become a powerful tool to help marketers as well as content editors.

Sitecore XConnect provides usefull information which can be later processed by a Machine Learning service to find behavior patterns amongst users by implementing mathematical modelling.

For this project we have used Gamification profiles according to the behavior the user has on the site. With this information we intend to enhance the userâ€™s engagement by adapting the site according to the gamification profile which is obtained via a Machine Learning service hosted on Azure which collects the user interactions though XConnect usage.  

For further information please check the [Documentation](https://github.com/Sitecore-Hackathon/2019-Senior-Meeseeks/tree/master/documentation) provided.
